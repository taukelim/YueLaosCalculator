        <h3>What is the Love Calculator based on?</h3>
        <p>
          This love calculator is based on the Drake Equation and
          <a href="./optimalstoppingtheory.html">Optimal Stopping Theory.</a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row faq-row">
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Yue Lao's Calculator accepts two user inputs. Personal metrics such as
          height, age, education and income-- and dating history. The Drake
          Equation is applied to filter a starting population down to a dating
          pool. Then Optimal Stopping Theory is applied to calculate the
          presence of the best candidate for a relationship.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row faq-row">
        <h3>How is my attractiveness calculated?</h3>
        <p>
          Attractiveness is calculated using a linear regression and areas of
          bell curves based on this informal
          <a href="./surveyresults.pdf">survey</a> of mostly South East Asian
          women conducted in 2022, carried out by the developer of the
          calculator. <br /><br />
          For height and education, preferences of minimum and maximum male
          height and education are mapped onto a bell curve. For example, a male
          that is too tall or too short will have a smaller area range of this
          bell curve, while males in the ideal range of height will have the
          largest area range. A bell curve is used because there are less
          extremely short and extremely tall women compared to average height
          women, as with education attainment.
          <br /><br />
          For income, linear regression is used to predict the correlation
          between increase in income and number of women specifying that income
          as acceptable for dating.
          <br /><br />
          For age, a double filter is used. Based on this United Nation's
          <a href="https://www.population-trends-asiapacific.org/data/sea"
            >data</a
          >, there is a rounded average of 1% of a population within each given
          age. This 1% is multiplied by the input age's acceptable dating range.
          Next the calculator filters how many people are married within their
          age range, to show the final percentage.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row faq-row">
        <h3>How is my dating pool calculated?</h3>
        <p>
          Based on your attractiveness, a starting population is slowly filtered
          down to get your dating pool. For example, a 160cm tall guy will have
          women 153cm and taller women filtered off from his dating pool as they
          prefer males atleast 8cm taller according to the survey.
        </p>

      <div class="row faq-row">
        <h3>What is the Drake Equation?</h3>
        <p>
          <i>From wikipedia:</i><br />
          The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the
          number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the
          Milky Way Galaxy. The equation was formulated in 1961 by Frank Drake.
          <br /><br />
          This calculator uses it to filter the number of datable people for a
          certain individual.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row faq-row">
        <h3>How accurate is the calculator?</h3>
        <p>
          It is not accurate as it is a representation of reality. Women's
          heights and education don't fit perfectly on a bell curve. A male's
          face and personality are not taken into account. Some women prioritize
          wealth over height, while this calculator treats all metrics as equal.

        <h3>Who is Yue Lao?</h3>
        <p>
          He is the Chinese god of marriage and love. He ties a red knot between
          you and your destined lover. Once tied, nothing can prevent your union
          with them. Read more on
